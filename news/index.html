                        <h2>"Income tax benefits, capital gains tax hike, cheaper phones | Key Budget takeaways”</h2>
                        <p>Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday proposed the much-awaited change in the income tax slabs as she tabled the first Union Budget of the new Narendra Modi government. The government raised the short-term capital gains tax (for less than a year) from 15 percent to 20 percent. The rate for those who hold their investments for longer than 12 months has risen from 10 percent to 12.5 percent.

                            Sitharaman said the main focus of the Budget was on employment, skilling, small businesses and the middle class.
                            
                            She said the government proposed “incentives for companies to train staff”. It also promised cheaper loans for higher education. Corporate tax for foreign companies was cut to 35% from 40%.</p>

                        <h2>The Indian middle class expected more</h2>
                        <p>Budget 2024 came at a rare moment in the history of Indian budgets. Tax revenues are up, bank and corporate balance sheets are cleaned up, reserves are looking good and a surprise bonus from the Reserve Bank of India has bolstered the ability of the government to spend without compromising the fiscal consolidation process. But there are two clouds on the horizon — slowing consumption growth and tepid private sector investment. There was a third issue in front of the government — the middle class wanted a break from the increased taxation it has faced over the years. While Budget 2024 has not addressed all these issues to everybody’s satisfaction, it has started the walk on the path that does.</p>

                        <h2>A missed opportunity on kickstarting farm reform</h2>
                        <p>In a departure from earlier years, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman acknowledged the importance of agriculture for the rural economy, inflation (management) and the country’s food security at the beginning of her speech. She did well to highlight the urgent need to develop climate-resistant varieties of seeds, touching upon the importance of driving agri-productivity and resilience. The Economic Survey for 2023-24, too, highlighted the contradictions and challenges confronting the agriculture sector, underscoring the threat of the climate crisis. One would be forgiven for assuming such concerns indicated a reforms push. Serious reforms in the agri-food sector have been debated for a long time. But the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has barely made any progress, even in important areas such as fertiliser subsidy, seamless movement of agri-produce across the states, and crop diversification in Punjab and Haryana.</p>
